# MarioModelsLibrary
This repo contains a bunch of Super Mario and Sonic the Hedgehog 3D modles from their various games.
If this really helps you out in development, please give us a star and follow us by pressing the little eye icon (or eye-con if you will) to recieve updates on future updates on new modles.

Also, here is a huge shout out to PlopesK for the help you've done!

## Note!
Mario Kart 64 and New Super Mario Bros. DS actually doesn't use any character model, they use 2D Sprites that look like 3D, which is quite ironic!
